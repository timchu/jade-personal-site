        p MaskBanao is a project built by a small group of students aiming to bring Pakistan's mask-wearing prevalence from zero to widespread. When we started, no one in Pakistan wore a mask. What started as a small idea grew into a team of over 35 students and professionals from 8 different countries.   
        p With Pakistan's 220 million people unprepared for the pandemic, we partnered with provincial governors and Pakistan's most famous celebrities to encourage universal mask wearing.

        p Besides for celebrity advocacy, we also discussed COVID strategy with Pakistani governors. By reaching out to our distant connections, our small team arranged a meeting in mid-April 2020 with the governor of Pakistan's most populous province to advise him on coronavirus policy. We later worked with more government officials, including technology advisers to the Prime Minister of Pakistan. 
        p Due to mask shortages, we created and delivered over 120,000 cloth masks to citizens of Pakistan's largest city.  MaskBanao was featured in Pakistan's largest #[a(href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1185249") newspapers], including BBC Urdu. Our Instagram was followed by over 10,000 users.

//-        p Together with our friends, we built a professional #[a(href="https://www.maskbanao.com") website] from scratch in 8 hours demonstrating the dangers of COVID, and instructing people how to make masks at home. Since Pakistan is a textile country, there would be lots of raw cloths for home-made masks. We named our team #[a(href="https://www.maskbanao.com") MaskBanao], meaning Masks for All in the Pakistani language Urdu.

//-        p One thing I learned is that in a time of crisis, even small folks like my friends and I can do a lot to help. 
//-        img(class="fit", src="images/maskbanao2.png")
//-        p Turns out, the first wave of COVID missed Pakistan (this is when we were most active). Then the Delta variant came and Pakistan had a lot of trouble. Lesson for next time? Advocacy is important, but so is timing.
//-        p Today, cloth masks are recommended only when medical masks are not available, a situation that certainly applied to Pakistan in early 2020. Medical masks, if available, are considered superior to cloth ones.
//-        p Our small team was not very well connected. We were just college students. We didn't have any serious influence in Pakistan, except for one team member was born there. But what we did have was the willingness to put in 16 hour days for months on end to make this project happen. Given the unprecedented situation, we did all we could to help out.

//-        p In April 2020, COVID was changing the world as we knew it. When the lives of 220 million Pakistanis were at stake, no one in Pakistan was wearing a mask. Pakistan's has a hundred times fewer hospital beds than the USA.
//-        p With potential death impending, a group of students including myself made it our mission to make mask-making the new normal in Pakistan. We strove to do as much as we could to save lives amidst a global pandemic.
