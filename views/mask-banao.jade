        p MaskBanao is a project built by a small group of students aiming to bring Pakistan's mask-wearing prevalence from zero to widespread.  When none of Pakistan's 220 million people were wearing a mask, MaskBanao partnered with Pakistan's provincial governors and famous celebrities to promote universal mask wearing.

        p What started out as a Pakistani friend and I discussing COVID in a dorm room, grew to be a mask making and wearing campaign that included dozens of designers, artists, government officials, and web developers from Pakistan to the Philippines to Croatia. Our campaign advised the governor of a Pakistani province containing 50 million people, created celebrity-backed mask videos that reached a hundred thousand, and delivered over 120,000 cloth masks to citizens of Pakistan.
        // When we started, no one in Pakistan wore a mask. What started as a small idea grew into a team of over 35 students and professionals from 8 different countries.

        //p Besides for celebrity advocacy, we also discussed COVID strategy with Pakistani governors. By reaching out to our distant connections, our small team arranged a meeting in mid-April 2020 with the governor of Pakistan's most populous province to advise him on coronavirus policy. We later worked with more government officials, including technology advisers to the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  The Pakistani government eventually issued a mask order during the first wave of the pandemic.

        //h3(class="center-text") Retrospective
        //p As time goes on, evidence has moved against cloth-based masks, which is what our campaign initially advocated. While cloth masks appear to be potentially helpful in settings where medical masks are not available, they appear to provide significantly less protection than medical masks. Our campaign was based on the available knowledge at the time, which suggested that cloth masks would be better than nothing. More research on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of cloth masks continues to be released daily.
