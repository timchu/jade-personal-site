        h1(style="text-align:center") Math in West Africa (MISE)
        br
        p In 2012, I volunteered for the #[a(href="https://misemaths.wordpress.com/") MISE program] in Ghana. This summer program discovers and educates the most promising students in Ghana in math and science.
        p I worked with MISE to build a math contest reaching 3000 top students across Ghana per year. MISE trains hundreds of students each year in Olympiad mathematics, computer science, and research topics ranging from AI to computational biology. Our dream is to educate the next generation of African scientists.

        p Through MISE, I co-founded the #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad") International Math Olympiad (IMO)] team in Ghana. The IMO is the Olympics of mathematics.

          p This year, our IMO team did not fare as well. We won't get a medal this year. We might not get a medal next year. But our program is about more than Olympiad medals. 
          p Our program is about doing something that has never happened in history: making a pipeline that trains and educates talented West Africans to compete at the highest levels of STEM. Olympiad medals or no, our journey goes on.

        h2(style="text-align:center") Meet The Alumni
        p Alumni of the MISE program have gone on to graduate from prestigious colleges around the world, including Princeton, Harvard, and MIT. Our program scouted them, taught them advanced mathematics/CS, and encouraged them to apply to colleges abroad. 
        p Due to our efforts, many of them were admitted to their top choice of college. Some alums have won the highest honors their university can bestow. One of the reasons I love the MISE program is because it enables talented individuals from West Africa to pursue scientific dreams at the best universities.

        h2 Testimonials
        p Jessica Quaye: "MISE changed my life - I would not have gotten into MIT if I did not know about MISE. Had I not participated in the MISE research summer camp, I would not have pursued EECS because I always thought I would go into Chemistry."
        br
        p Jesse Phillips: "MISE was one of the best experiences of my life, and one of the main reasons I decided to pursue computer science and math. Mentors like Timothy Chu and Professor Mark Saul provided wonderful opportunities. The best thing about the MISE program is the exposure you get, to many other smart kids like yourself. 
        p "And you're learning many cool things you don't learn in the main Ghanaian curriculum. I had the opportunity to go to the International Math Olympiad, to meet other people from other countries. It was a mindblowing experience."

        h2 Ongoing Challenges

        p I co-founded Ghana's International Math Olympiad (IMO) team via MISE. The IMO is the hardest and most prestigious math contest in the world. You sit down for 9 hours to do 6 extremely challenging problems. Most professional mathematicians find it challenging to solve more than 2 such problems.
        p It wasn't easy getting a team together for the IMO. Most parents have never heard of math Olympiads before. There is barely any math contest presence in West Africa. Moreover, only 3 percent of adults from Ghana have a college degree. This compares with close to 30 percent in most Western countries. Parents with college degrees are more likely to help their children do math contests and STEM.
        p Ghana is not a rich country. They are undergoing rolling power outages called #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumsor") dumsor] (there's a Wikipedia article for it!), which prevent students from using the internet on a regular basis. Poor students don't have access to good schooling, much less math competitions. Moreover, the IMO is an incredibly hard contest. Its winners usually have been pushed into contest math by parents since elementary school, and they often participated in a robust network of math contests since middle school. Students in Ghana do not have this advantage.
        strong Uphill Struggle 
        p Members of our IMO team like Roni Edwin and Keith Torpey have solved challenging questions on the IMO. However, it is just a shade too challenging for the rest of our students. They're brilliant, dedicated, but don't have the robust resources and networks that math competitors in the USA, China, or Russia have. The IMO is also getting harder: Despite our combined efforts producing a talented IMO team, we did not score so well this year. 
        p Perhaps the IMO is not the right direction for MISE Ghana. After all, we are most concerned about equipping bright students all around Ghana with the education to do STEM at the highest levels. This path does not have to run through the IMO. There are plenty of ways we can educate students without them having to compete at the International Math Olympiad. 
        p We are currently thinking about expanding online math circles to all of Africa, free of charge for any student to participate. We are also expanding competitive programming classes across Ghana. These are one of the many ideas we are considering. If you would like to be part of this, or if you have other ideas that can help bring talented Africans to compete globally at STEM, please email me at timothyzchu [at] gmail [dot] com.
