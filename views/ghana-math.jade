        h1(style="text-align:center") Math in West Africa (MISE)
        p In 2012, I volunteered for the #[a(href="https://misemaths.wordpress.com/") MISE program] in Ghana. This summer program discovers and trains the most promising students in Ghana in math and science.
        p Together, we built a math contest reaching 3000 top students across Ghana per year. We train hundreds of students each year in Olympiad mathematics, computer science, and research topics ranging from AI to computational biology. Our dream is to educate the next generation of African scientists.

        p Through MISE, I co-founded the #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad") International Math Olympiad (IMO) team ] in Ghana, and the first Math Olympiad training program in the country. I've been building this program for over a decade.
