        h2(style="text-align:center") Beginnings
        p In April of 2020, a friend of mine from MIT and I realized that COVID was likely to hit Pakistan very hard. Pakistan is an incredibly dense country with over 200 million people, with a large city five times more crowded than New York. No one in Pakistan was taking COVID seriously at the time.  No one wore a mask. At the time, the World Health Organization was urging healthy people not to wear a mask.
        h2(style="text-align:center") Mask Making and Promotion
        p We formed a team dedicated to promoting masks in Pakisan, and called ourselves #[a(href="https://www.maskbanao.com") MaskBanao].  Within weeks, we produced mask advocacy videos with Pakistani celebrities including Hadiqa Kiani and Ayesha Omar.

        h2(style="text-align:center") Policy Advising and Action
        p Within five days of forming our team, our small team met with the governor of Pakistan's most populous province to advise him on coronavirus policy. We worked with government officials from all areas, including technology advisers to the Prime Minister of Pakistan. 
        p Due to mask shortages, we created and delivered over 120,000 cloth masks to citizens of Pakistan's densely populated capital, Karachi.  MaskBanao was featured in Pakistan's largest #[a(href="https://images.dawn.com/news/1185249") newspapers], including BBC Urdu.  During this unprecedented crisis, my friends and I strove to do our part.

        h2 What I Learned
        p One thing I learned is that in a time of crisis, even small folks like my friends and I can do a lot to help. 
        img(class="fit", src="images/maskbanao2.png")
        p Turns out, the first wave of COVID missed Pakistan (this is when we were most active). Then the Delta variant came and Pakistan had a lot of trouble. Lesson for next time? Advocacy is important, but so is timing.
        p Today, cloth masks are recommended only when medical masks are not available, a situation that certainly applied to Pakistan in early 2020. Medical masks, if available, are considered superior to cloth ones.
        p Our small team was not very well connected. We were just college students. We didn't have any serious influence in Pakistan, except for one team member was born there. But what we did have was the willingness to put in 16 hour days for months on end to make this project happen. Given the unprecedented situation, we did all we could to help out.

Since Pakistan is a textile country, there would be lots of raw cloths for home-made masks.
