This summer program discovers and trains the most promising students in Ghana in math and science.</p><p>Together, we built a math contest reaching 3000 top students across Ghana. We train hundreds of students each year in Olympiad mathematics, computer science, and research topics ranging from AI to computational biology. Our dream is to educate the next generation of African scientists. </p><img src="images/mise-girl.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1.5cm" class="fit"><p>Through MISE, I co-founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad">International Math Olympiad (IMO) team </a> in Ghana, and the first Math Olympiad training program in the country. I've been building this program for over a decade.</p><br><br><h2 style="text-align:center">Alumni Achievements </h2><p>In 2020, two MISE alums won the top engineer awards at MIT and Princeton, an unprecedented feat in West African history. They each credit MISE heavily for its success.</p><img src="images/jessica-quaye.png" class="fit"><div style="margin-bottom: 1.5cm"> <strong>MISE alumnus Jessica Quaye won the 2020 MIT top engineer award.

Other alums have gone on to work at e-commerce startups in Zimbabwe, win scholarships at MIT, organize coding workshops in West Africa, work at Google, become metallurgical engineers in Ghana, study chemical engineering in Atlanta, and more.</p><br><br><h2 style="text-align:center">Ghana Math Olympiad Achivements</h2><img src="images/roni-edwin.jpg" class="fit"><div style="margin-bottom: 1.5cm"> <strong>Roni Edwin (left) is a member of the Ghana IMO team. </strong><span>In 2020, Roni became the seventh black individual in history to medal at the IMO, and he achieved the highest score in all of Africa that year.
