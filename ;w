        p The MISE program in Ghana discovers and educates the most promising STEM students in Ghana.  Each year, we select hundreds of Ghanaian students from over 3000 top students around the country. We train them in advanced math and computer science.  MISE alumni have gone on to win highest honors at MIT and Princeton, and achieve distinction at international math contests.
        p I've worked with  MISE for almost a decade to bring the best math and science education to the brightest minds in Africa.  If you would like to learn more or volunteer with us, email me at #[a(href="mailto:timothyzchu@gmail.com") timothyzchu [at] gmail [dot] com!]

          strong Jesse Phillips: 
          span "MISE was one of the best experiences of my life, and one of the main reasons I decided to pursue computer science and math. Mentors like Timothy Chu and Professor Mark Saul provided wonderful opportunities. The best thing about the MISE program is the exposure you get, to many other smart kids like yourself."
        //p "And you're learning many cool things you don't learn in the main Ghanaian curriculum. I had the opportunity to go to the International Math Olympiad, to meet other people from other countries. It was a mindblowing experience."

//        h2 Ongoing Challenges
//
//        p I co-founded Ghana's International Math Olympiad (IMO) team via MISE. The IMO is the hardest and most prestigious math contest in the world. You sit down for 9 hours to do 6 extremely challenging problems. Most professional mathematicians find it challenging to solve more than 2 such problems.
//        p It wasn't easy getting a team together for the IMO. Most parents have never heard of math Olympiads before. There is barely any math contest presence in West Africa. Moreover, only 3 percent of adults from Ghana have a college degree. This compares with close to 30 percent in most Western countries. Parents with college degrees are more likely to help their children do math contests and STEM.
//        p Ghana is not a rich country. They are undergoing rolling power outages called #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumsor") dumsor] (there's a Wikipedia article for it!), which prevent students from using the internet on a regular basis. Poor students don't have access to good schooling, much less math competitions. Moreover, the IMO is an incredibly hard contest. Its winners usually have been pushed into contest math by parents since elementary school, and they often participated in a robust network of math contests since middle school. Students in Ghana do not have this advantage.
//        strong Uphill Struggle 
//        p Members of our IMO team like Roni Edwin and Keith Torpey have solved challenging questions on the IMO. However, it is just a shade too challenging for the rest of our students. They're brilliant, dedicated, but don't have the robust resources and networks that math competitors in the USA, China, or Russia have. The IMO is also getting harder: Despite our combined efforts producing a talented IMO team, we did not score so well this year. 
//        p Perhaps the IMO is not the right direction for MISE or Ghana. First and foremost, we are concerned about equipping bright students all around Ghana with the education to do STEM at the highest levels. This path does not have to run through the IMO. There are plenty of ways we can educate students without them having to compete at the International Math Olympiad. 
//        p We are currently thinking about expanding online math circles to all of Africa, free of charge for any student to participate. We are also expanding competitive programming classes across Ghana. These are one of the many ideas we are considering. If you would like to be part of this, or if you have other ideas that can help bring talented Africans to compete globally at STEM, please email me at timothyzchu [at] gmail [dot] com.
